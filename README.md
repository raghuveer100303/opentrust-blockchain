# Project Title


**opentrust blockchain**


## Project Description


Opentrust Blockchain is a lightweight solidity-based crowdfunding smart contract that enables creators to create projects, backers to pledge funds, and project owners to withdraw funds once funding goals are met. This repository includes a minimal, secure `Project.sol` contract demonstrating typical crowdfunding mechanics, with simple protections and clear events.


## Project Vision


To provide a transparent, auditable, and minimal on-chain crowdfunding primitive that developers can extend into DAOs, escrow services, or integrated marketplaces — prioritizing simplicity, security, and auditability.


## Key Features


- Create projects with a funding goal and description.
- Backers can pledge ETH to any open project.
- Automatic project closing when the funding goal is reached.
- Secure withdraw flow for project owners once goals are met.
- Simple contributor accounting to inspect individual contributions.


## Future Scope


- Add refund mechanism for failed campaigns.
- Integrate ERC20 support (allow pledges in tokens).
- Add governance / DAO features for fund usage approval.
- Add off-chain metadata through IPFS/Arweave links for large descriptions and media.
- Add unit tests, CI config, and a Hardhat/Foundry project scaffold.
